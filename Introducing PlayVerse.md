Introducing PlayVerse
PlayVerse's vision is to create an immersive, impartial and inclusive ecosystem for web3 gamers worldwide. It is a Web3 Game Streaming & Community Management Platform.

###üßê Problem Statement

Centralised streaming platforms exploit streamers' hard work and community influence through unfair compensation practices, lacking transparency and consensus.

Gamers invest significant time and money in games without receiving ownership, alignment, or governance, highlighting the absence of a GameFi streaming infrastructure for crypto and NFT payouts.

Transitioning from web2 game publishers' methods of acquiring and retaining users (paid ads, paid media) to a Web3 approach based on contribution (airdrops, referrals, engagement) is needed.

###üí° Idea / Solution PlayVerse is an interactive online gaming and learning platform that provides live gaming tutorials and tournaments for games built on the Aptos blockchain.

The next evolutionary step is towards the Gamefi streaming platform. Create a sustainable ecosystem running on blockchain where game publishers, streamers and the gamer community all benefit from the contribution.

We empower streamers by eliminating high commission rates, eradicating arbitrary increases imposed solely by the company, significantly reducing holding periods for funds, providing clear and concise guidelines regarding account bans based on legal matters, ensuring complete transparency, and fostering a strong sense of community consensus. By doing so, we restore the integrity of the streaming ecosystem and bolster the invaluable influence and support that streamers have diligently cultivated to achieve remarkable success.
